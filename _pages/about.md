**Hey there!**

I’m Borys Łangowicz, a tech enthusiast based in [Toronto](https://www.toronto.ca/) and currently studying Computer Science and Statistics at the [University of Toronto](https://www.utoronto.ca/).

My goal in life is to make a difference, using the skills I own. Somehow it ended up, that I am not that bad with computers, and that is probably the reason you are here.

I use my knowledge to solve real-life problems, help companies use cutting-edge technologies, and build for the community. Now having a pleasure to work as Machine Learning Developer at [UTMIST](https://utmist.gitlab.io/).

That why aside from my freelance I work with a team of great people at [Google Developer Student Club UTSC](https://www.linkedin.com/company/gdscutsc/mycompany/) to create country-wide study groups, conferences ([DevFest Canada](https://gdsc.devfest.ca/), [WiT Conference](https://gdsc.community.dev/events/details/developer-student-clubs-university-of-toronto-mississauga-presents-international-womens-day-women-in-tech-conference-2024/)), and [GenAI Genesis - The Largest AI Hackathon in Canada](https://genaigenesis.ca/) (Soon to be the largest in America!).

In my free time, I write [sub-optimal code](https://github.com/neloduka-sobe?tab=repositories), [win hackathons](https://devpost.com/neloduka-sobe),  [run mountain ultramarathons](https://utmb.world/en/runner/4769372.borys.langowicz), read, and lift metal in a repetitive manner.
